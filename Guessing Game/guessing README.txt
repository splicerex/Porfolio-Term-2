I got ahead of my class so my teacher gave me this project to do early so I wouldn't have nothing to do. 

This is a simple guess the number game where the computer pick a random number between 1-100.

The player has 5 chances to guess the number correctly. If the guess is too high the computer will display 'Too High.' If the guess is too low the computer will display 'Too Low'.

The game also includes a menu for the player to choose between three options:

Play - Plays the Game Normally

Options - Allows the player to set the range of numbers to guess from.

Credits - Displays the credits.

Exit - Kills the game.
